= Synopsis

In your dist.ini:

  [TestMLIncluder]

= Description

This Dist::Zilla plugin allows you to ship your module with `.t` files written
in the "TestML"[http://testml.org/] language rather then in Perl. Your module
does not need to add any dependencies (like `TestML`) to do this.

This plugin does the following (when you `dzil build`):

* Adds the latest TestML sources into `inc/lib/`
* Adds the `testml-cpan` program to `inc/bin/`
* Modifies your TestML `.t` file's shebang lines to use `testml-cpan`
* Precompiles your TestML files into `inc/t/...` files

Not only does this make TestML easy to use for CPAN modules, it also ensures
that the exact TestML code you tested with locally is being used by people
installing your module. ie It makes your CPAN distribution future-proof to any
TestML language changes.
