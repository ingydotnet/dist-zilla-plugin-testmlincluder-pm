=head1 Name

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TestMLIncluder - Ship your TestML version

=head1 Version

This document describes L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TestMLIncluder> version B<0.17>.

=head1 Synopsis

In your dist.ini:

    [TestMLIncluder]

=head1 Description

This Dist::Zilla plugin allows you to ship your module with C<.t> files
written in the L<TestML|http://testml.org/> language rather then in Perl. Your
module does not need to add any dependencies (like C<TestML>) to do this.

This plugin does the following (when you C<dzil build>):

=over

=item * Adds the latest TestML sources into C<inc/lib/>

=item * Adds the C<testml-cpan> program to C<inc/bin/>

=item * Modifies your TestML C<.t> file's shebang lines to use C<testml-cpan>

=item * Precompiles your TestML files into C<inc/t/...> files

=back

Not only does this make TestML easy to use for CPAN modules, it also ensures
that the exact TestML code you tested with locally is being used by people
installing your module. ie It makes your CPAN distribution future-proof to any
TestML language changes.
